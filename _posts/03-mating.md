"The mating season for foxes are  December to February when the female fox (vixen) can be heard at night uttering her eerie, high pitched scream. 
The Foxes primarily form monogamous pairs each winter. The pair stay together to act as parents to the new born kits (cubs or pups) after a gestation period of between 51 and 53 days."
A litter of 4 – 6 kits are produced each year, however, litters may be as large as 13. Kits are born blind and may weigh as much as 150 grams (0.33 pounds
"The kits eyes are open by 2 weeks and the kits have taken their first exploratory steps out of the den by 5 weeks, by 10 weeks they are fully weaned. 
They remain with their mother until Autumn when they disperse at approximately 8 – 10 months old to find territories and mates of their own."
